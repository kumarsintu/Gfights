# Logging using Log4j
I have provided logging logic in LoggingExpect.java class i.e followed the Spring AOP concept for all the methods of DAO and Service class after throwing an exception on error level. <br/>

If you want to get the log details into a file then create a folder(named as logs) and add a file(error.log) into that folder and define the path of this log file in the application.properties file- logging.file=logs/error.log
